# TimeInCC

Tweak was developed on iOS 14 using checkra1n jailbreak. Might not be working on current iOS versions anymore.
It overrides the sensor data in control center which displays whether the camera or mic is currently being used.
With this tweak, the view element instead always shows the current time, no matter if any sensors are currently being accessed from device.
